### Problem Statement (Addressed)

-   Browse and choose activities from a predefined set (brunch, hiking, movie night, reading, etc.)
-   Add selected activities into a **weekend schedule (Saturday + Sunday)**
-   View the plan in a **visual, calendar-style format**
-   Edit or remove activities from the schedule
-   Extended features for personalization, categories, vibes, and thematic planning

### Major Design Decisions & Trade-offs

-   **Activity Library vs Free-form Input**: Chose a predefined library of activities (with categories, icons, and vibes) to keep UX simple, but allowed extensibility for future custom activities.
-   **State Management**: Used Redux to manage global state (activities, categories, schedule, vibes). Chose Redux over Context for predictable updates and debugging.
-   **Thematic Sub-calendars**: Created a system for separate ‚Äúmini-calendars‚Äù (e.g., Work, Family, Fitness), enabling filtering and isolated views.
-   **Persistence**: Implemented MongoDB storage for activities and schedules instead of localStorage, trading off simplicity for scalability.
-   **Hosting Choice**: Used Netlify for frontend (lightweight SPA hosting) and DigitalOcean for backend (control + scalability).

### Component Design & State Management

-   **Reusable Components**: Built modular components for Activity Cards, Category Filters, Schedule Timeline, Mood Picker, and Sub-calendars.
-   **Visual Schedule**: Schedule displayed in a calendar/timeline format, with drag-and-drop positioning considered for future versions.
-   **Category & Vibe Metadata**: Each activity has metadata (category, color scheme, vibe icon) to allow easy filtering and identification.
-   **Filters**: Users can toggle categories or sub-calendars to focus on one type of task at a time.

### UI & Experience

-   **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
-   **Clear Visuals**: Activities color-coded by category; vibe icons for mood context.
-   **Smooth Interactions**: Animations and polished transitions to make scheduling fun.
-   **Thematic Planning**: Ability to create ‚ÄúAdventurous Weekend,‚Äù ‚ÄúLazy Weekend,‚Äù etc. with filtered sub-calendars.

### Creative Features / Integrations

-   Category system with **color schemes** for quick recognition
-   **Icons for vibes** (happy, relaxed, energetic) and categories (food, travel, fitness, etc.)
-   **Sub-calendar creation** for thematic separation of different task types
-   **Filtering system** to isolate tasks/events by category or sub-calendar
-   Persistence of plans in MongoDB for long-term storage
-   Holiday-awareness integration for suggesting upcoming long weekends

## 4. Deployment Summary

-   Frontend ‚Üí Netlify (SPA routing with `_redirects`)
-   Backend ‚Üí DigitalOcean (Express.js API)
-   Database ‚Üí MongoDB Atlas

---

## 5. Super Stretch Goals (Attempted)

-   **Persistence**: Plans stored in MongoDB instead of only local state
-   **Scalability**: Architecture supports 50+ activities with smooth performance
-   **Offline-first exploration**: Initial work done with caching static assets and storing data in local storage in offline mode once connectivity is there stores in mongoDB
-   **Reusable Components**: Designed with scalability in mind (mini design system approach)
